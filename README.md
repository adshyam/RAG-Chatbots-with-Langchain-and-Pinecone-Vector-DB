**RAG-Chatbots with LangChain and Pinecone Vector DB**

Building RAG Chatbots with LangChain and Pinecone Vector Database

**Overview**

Welcome to the repository for the rag_chatbot.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This notebook is dedicated to demonstrating the creation and functionality of a chatbot using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technique. The chatbot leverages advanced NLP methods to provide informative and contextually relevant responses, making it an ideal resource for those interested in AI-driven conversational agents.

In this project, we'll work on building an AI chatbot from start to finish. We will use **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **Pinecone's vector DB** to build a chatbot capable of learning from the external world using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

We will use a dataset sourced from the **Llama 2 ArXiv paper** and other related papers to help our chatbot answer questions about the latest advancements in the world of GenAI.

By the end of this example, we'll have a functioning chatbot and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on a knowledge base.

**Features**

Chatbot Development: A step-by-step guide on building a chatbot using RAG.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Incorporates RAG to enhance the chatbot's response generation by retrieving relevant information and context.

Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot, inputting their queries and receiving responses.

Analysis of Chatbot Performance: Insights into the capabilities and limitations of the RAG-based chatbot in various conversational scenarios.

**Prerequisites**
Before we start building our chatbot, we need to install some Python libraries. Here's a brief overview of what each library does:

langchain: A library for GenAI. We'll use it to chain together different language models and components for our chatbot.

openai: The official OpenAI Python client. We'll use it to interact with the OpenAI API and generate responses for our chatbot.

datasets: Provides a vast array of datasets for machine learning. We'll use it to load our knowledge base for the chatbot.

pinecone-client: The official Pinecone Python client. We'll use it to interact with the Pinecone API and store our chatbot's knowledge base in a vector database.
